            <h2><bold>Steps</bold></h2>
            <li>
              Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
              yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the
              olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a
              soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and
              knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set
              aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not
              essential for a thin crust.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic
              together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature
              while you get on with shaping the base.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick
              knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out
              the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling
              pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.
              Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another
              baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
              shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
              with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put
              one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated
              sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little
              more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for
              remaining pizza.
